between occludin and occluded, there is an area we cant see, which to be explore, there is a space the robot might go to expand the map 



global view = combination of local views

slam = simultaneous localization and mapping

global view 0 = local view 0 

laser = rangefinder = more like sonar 
vision is different, no range (but stereo camera can)
Answer: add another camera to form stereo image to improve rovio to do SLAM, distance based input to get cartesian coordinate to do mapping

update global view with every local view after each movement = slam 
slam desperately need coordinate

updating need reference frame

every local view has coordinate

after each movement, reverse the movement then add the new coordination at the original global view
transition first then rotation (when reversing)
because when move, always turn then move 

Question: reverse until original position (all the moves) or just one move 
if all the moves, more drifting, cant map correctly 

drifting prevention
every movement have to move to a point that can be mapped to the refer frame

drifting
1. environment: friction,windy (drone)
2. circuit faulty: motor issues (calibration), power inbalance (wire transfer power differently, short circuited)
3.
