1. Identify pioneers (key players) of neural computing. (5 names & their expertise) e.g. Bayes [5 marks]
- Thomas Bayes (Statistics) -> Discover Bayes' Theorem
- Andrei Andreyevich Markov (Mathematics) -> Discover Markov chains
- Marvin Minsky (Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Artifical Intelligence) -> Discover First neural network, the SNARC
- Frank Rosenblatt (Psychology) -> Discover Perceptron
- Kunihiko Fukushima (Electrical Engineering) -> Discover Neocognitron

2. List 4 examples of neural computing application in various fields [4 marks]
- Medical -> Diagnosing cancer disease using demographic data
- Security -> Facial recognition
- E-mail -> Spam filtering
- Financial -> Automated trading system

3. Explain 3 motivations of neural computing research (advantages) [6 marks]
- Computational power -> Multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, using special rational valued weights can result in the power of universal Turing machine using a finite number of neurons.
- Capacity -> Able to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, just like in real-life where most relationships between input and output are non-linear and complex
- Generalization -> Able to infer unseen relationships on unseen data after learning from initial inputs and their relationships, making the model generalize and predict on unseen data
