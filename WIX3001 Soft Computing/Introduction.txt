soft computing
- deals iwth approximate models 
- gives solutions to complex real-life problems
- tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation
- role model: human mind
- techniques: fuzzy logic, genetic algo, ANN, machine learning and expert systems
- introduced in 1980s
- now major research in automatic control engineering
- low-cost and very-high-performance digital processor and reduction of cost of memory chips -> expand SC
- achieve practicability, robustness and low cost solution
- involve evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algo / bio-inspired computation
