1. List the advantages of Artificial Neural Networks compared with traditional hard computing methods. [3 marks]

Hard computing require precisely stated analytical model and often a lot of computation time. ANN tolerates imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation.
Hard computing based on binary logic, crisp system and numerical analysis. ANN is based on the human mind, biological neuron.
Hard computing require exact input data, ANN is able to handle noise and adapt to changes.

2. Identify applications of Artificial Neural Network.[2 marks] 

Spam email filtering
Pattern recognition

3. Describe the components of a biological neuron.[5 marks]

Dendrites: Input receiver
Cell body / Soma: Housing nucleus
Nucleus: Processing unit
Axon: Output transmit
Synapse: Connection between neurons

4. Explain the components of an artificial neuron. [5 marks]

Input: Input from the data
Weightage: Acting as the "memory" for the perceptron
Bias: For tuning / supervised learning of the perceptron
Summation function: Summing the input to a value
Activation function: Generating output based on the value from summation function
Output: Output generated from the perceptron
